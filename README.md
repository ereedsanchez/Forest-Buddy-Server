# Forest-Buddy-Server
Forest-Buddy-Server is an AI-powered platform that connects wildlife monitoring cameras through a wifi mesh network in forest environments, enabling seamless data transmission to a central on-site server. The system leverages YOLO-based object detection for automated wildlife identification and is currently being tested at Black Rock Forest and Bronx Community College, demonstrating its adaptability across different environmental monitoring applications. This documentation provides detailed instructions for deploying and configuring the Forest-Buddy server component, including prerequisites, installation steps, and troubleshooting guidance.

## Forest Buddy Install 
Prerequisites
- Windows 10 | Windows 11
- Intel/AMD Processors [Has not been tested on the M1 Chipset]
- Nvidia 20 series GPU and above

## Install
Make sure to download the following softwares in the order listed.

### 1. Visual Studio Community Edition 
[Link](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&channel=Release&version=VS2022&source=VSLandingPage&passive=false&cid=2030)

Download should appear in Downloads list. Run file. Click on Individual Components tab and scroll down to Compiler s, build tools, and runtimes.

Scroll down the list and tick *only* the boxes starting with C++ ie. (C++ 2022 Redistributable MSMs, C++ 2022 Redistributable Update)

**_Make sure to not tick the boxes of the packages labeled [Deprecated, Out of Support]_**

**Install >  Continue**


### 2. Nvidia Nsight Visual Studio Edition 
[Link](https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-visual-studio-edition)

*Nvidia Developer Account may be necessary*

Upon installation, next > Confirm you want the packages to install and press next until you see  Install. Click install.


### 3. Anaconda
[Link](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success)

Run the installer and press Next and be sure to Agree to Terms of Service.

Click **Just for Me**

#### In **Advanced Installation Option** be sure to have checked 
- Add Anaconda to my PATH Environment variable
- Register Anadconda as my default Python

**Install**



### 4. CUDA Toolkit  12.1
[Link](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-12-1-0-download-archive)


#### We choose CUDA 12.1 because it is supported by the latest stable version of PyTORCH (2.3.1)


Choose appropriate options for Target Platform to download
- ie. ***Windows, x86_64, Windows 10/11, exe (local)*** 

Run installer > Agree and Continue > **Custom(Advanced)** > Make sure that ONLY **CUDA** is ticked. > Next 


### 5. cuDNN
[Link](https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-archive)

*Nvidia Developer Account may be necessary*

Make sure to choose the appropriate version. We are using the Cuda 12.1 So choose the first for CUDA 12.x  

Download Local Installer for Windows(Zip)

Your download should have a name similar to cudnn-windows-x86_64-8.9.7.29_cuda12-archive.zip > *Open* > Click on lib > x64

On your machine: Open Explorer > Local Disk > Program Files > Nvidia GPU Computing Toolkit > CUDA > v12.1 

From the downloaded cuDNN archive go into **x64** and copy the contents inside that folder and transfer them over to the corresponding folder on your machine. Lib > x64

Do the same with files from the **include** and **bin** folders


### 6. Pytorch
[Link](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)

Make sure to choose Appropriately for the system configured. 

Here we are using 
- Stable(2.3.1)
- Windows
- Conda
- Python
- Cuda 12.1

It should give you a command similar to :  
```
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia
```
Open up start menu and go to anaconda prompt and input this command to install



#### Verify torch/cuda version

```
python
```

<br>


```
import torch
torch.__version__
torch.cuda.is_available()
```
<br>

To exit:
```
exit()
```

### 7. Ultralytics

For good practice, in the name of tidiness, make a directory for each of your projects that contain all its respective files. <br>
I will create a folder called yolov8 in my C:\Users\YourName\ Directory and i will cd into that directory.

Because I am using yolov8, i will create a yolov8 virtual environment(venv)

```
conda create -n yolov8 python=3.9
conda activate yolov8
pip install ultralytics
```

```
pip3 install --upgrade torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
```


**And to make recheck and sure CUDA is activated for us to use re-enter these commands:


```
python
```

```
import torch
torch.__version__
torch.cuda.is_available()
```

To exit: 
```
exit()
```






## Models
  To get started, navigate to the directory you created and activate your venv. I decided to make a yolov8 directory in my Users Directory
  
  
  cd C:\Users\YourName\yolov8 

 ```
 conda activate yolov8
 ```


Choose detection model for use case:[Link](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics?tab=readme-ov-file)

I will use the **yolov8x.pt model** <br>
Pick one that fits your use case. I usually use a form of one below.

```
yolo task=detect mode=predict model=yolov8x.pt source=XXXXXXXXX show=true conf=0.7 line_width=2
yolo task=classify mode=predict model=yolov8x-cls.pt source=XXXXXXXXX show=true conf=0.7 line_width=2
```

As you see my model automtically downloads itself to my yolov8 directory upon use.
**Be aware you will recieve an error due to source. so be sure to input a source file to be inferenced.**

Set source=photo.jpg <br> 
Set source=video.mp4 <br> 
Set source= Link to Youtube Video <br>
Set source=0 for Internal Webcam <br> 
Set source=http://CameraSource <br> 
Set source=Directory 

[confidence] conf=0.5 <br>
[show real time] show=true <br>
[save bounding box info] save_txt=true <br>
[save cropped obj] save_crop=true <br>
[hide labels] hide_labels=true<br>
[hide conf] hide_conf=true <br>
line_width=1 <br>

## Training 

If you are using PyCharm to train your model be sure to use terminal in pycharm to install ultralytics with:

```
pip install ultralytics
```
As PyCharm utilizes sandboxed virtual environements to run its code. Be sure to include any other dependencies you may need. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

```
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Create a new YOLO model from scratch
model = YOLO("yolov8n.yaml")


# Train the model using the 'coco8.yaml' dataset for 3 epochs
results = model.train(data="config.yaml", epochs=100)
```
```
path: C:\Users\YourName\Dataset\ *root_directory
train: C:\Users\YourName\Dataset\ *train #relative path to path
val: C:\Users\YourName\Dataset\ *valid #relative path to path


#All classes
names: ['xxxx']
  0: xxxx
 
```
## Errors we've encountered.

1. We ran into an issue when running the model itself, we used a youtube video as a source, and after it downloaded its depencies, it failed to open the youtube video. We uninstalled and reinstalled conda, and followed the steps from step 3 onwards, skipping step 4 and 5. if that fails, we recomend uninstalling all the installed files, and re-attempting the install.
